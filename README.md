## Description
Matrix Calculator

The Matrix Calculator is a Java application developed using JavaFX that allows users to perform various operations on matrices. It provides a user-friendly interface to input matrices and perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding the inverse, and calculating the determinant.

## Key Features:
1. Matrix Operations: Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on matrices of any size. The calculator supports matrices with both integer and decimal values.
2. Inverse Calculation: Calculate the inverse of a matrix. The application checks if the matrix is invertible and displays the result.
3. Determinant Calculation: Compute the determinant of a square matrix. The calculator supports matrices of any size and calculates the determinant using an efficient algorithm.
4. User-Friendly Interface: The calculator provides an intuitive interface with input fields to enter matrix elements and buttons to perform operations. Matrices are displayed in a visually appealing format.
5. Error Handling: The application includes error handling mechanisms to prevent invalid input, such as entering non-numeric characters or incompatible matrix dimensions for operations.
6. Matrix Validation: The calculator validates matrices for compatibility before performing operations, ensuring that the dimensions of input matrices meet the required criteria.
 
 
 ## Usage
 1. Addition/Subtraction: Enter the dimensions of the matrices and input the elements row-wise. Select the operation (addition or subtraction) and click the corresponding button to get the result.
 2. Multiplication: Enter the dimensions of the matrices and input the elements row-wise. Click the multiplication button to obtain the product matrix.
 3. Division: Enter the dimensions of the matrices and input the elements row-wise. Click the division button to calculate the quotient matrix.
 4. Inverse: Enter the dimensions of the matrix and input the elements row-wise. Click the inverse button to find the inverse matrix if it exists.
 5. Determinant: Enter the dimensions of the square matrix and input the elements row-wise. Click the determinant button to compute the determinant.
